To our contributors -- thank you for [helping us](/community) make Absinthe
better!

## Designer

A very special thanks to [Lynn Wallenstein](https://github.com/lynnwallenstein),
without whose help this website would really just be a collection of README
text, strewn around in random piles.

## Corporate Support

Absinthe was originally built out of a need for a flexible Elixir-based
API at [CargoSense](http://cargosense.com), a logistics intelligence company. As
a company committed to open source, CargoSense is proud to support Absinthe's
continued development.
